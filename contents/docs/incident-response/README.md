# [Standard Devz Processes](../README.md) / Incident Response

## Overview

Incident response is an important part of maintaining a reliable, secure
service. There are a number of components to incident response, starting
with how I prepare for incidents with on-call, through the actual process
of responding to service or security incidents, to how I follow through
with the post-incident retrospective (aka postmortem) process.
