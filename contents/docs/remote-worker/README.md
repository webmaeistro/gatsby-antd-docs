# There are 3 prerequisites and 4 essential components of a successful collaborative process

> Prerequisites: Your Mindset

-Everyone has something of value to contribute
-Build relationships before you need them
-Leverage other people’s skills and knowledge whenever you can

> Essential Components of Collaboration

-Establish alignment
-Listen like they are on your side
-Be a scientist
-Resolve conflicts

## Prerequisite: Mindset

To  truly embrace the idea of listening to other people’s ideas and trying  to leverage the best knowledge and intelligence of the members of the  group, a specific mindset is required. You must have an approach which  incorporates the following:

### Everyone has something of value to contribute

This  is an extension of humility. If you don’t know the solution, it follows  that you won’t know in advance where contributions to that solution  will come from.

### Build relationships before you need them

When  you’re in the midst of a collaboration, your blood pressure can rise.  You can get emotionally invested. Having a pre-existing relationship can  make a big difference.

### Leverage other people’s skills and knowledge whenever you can

Seek  out anyone who knows anything that could contribute to learning more  about the solution. Whether it’s a 5 min chat in the hallway or 30 min  learning from an expert. Seek others’ knowledge.

Once you’re in the right state of mind, you’re ready to dig into the...

## Mechanics of collaboration

1. ### Establish alignment

Are you both working toward solving the same problem?

Tactics:

Ask “What problem are I trying to solve?

2. ### Listen (like they’re on your side)

When  someone says something in earnest, step into their shoes and take their  suggestion seriously, even if it conflicts with preconceived notions

Annihilate  in-group/out-group behavior by making everyone part of the “in-group”.  Treat them like someone on the same side as you.

Seek to understand their position fully.

Tactics:

Respond “Yes, and” instead of “No”

Saying  “yes, and” starts at where the other person is, assumes they aren’t  crazy, and lets you move forward toward a solution together.

Saying “no” rejects the other person’s vision of how something should work. You lose their contribution.

Say “Maybe they’re right” to yourself

3. ### Be a scientist

Treat every non-factual assertion like a falsifiable hypothesis -- and hypotheses are testable.

Tactics:

State facts, not opinions

Don’t bullshit

Be willing to say “I don’t know”

When you’re coming in to a problem tasked with solving it, it’s tempting to present as an expert. Don’t be tempted.

State facts that you know to be true, and direct experience.

If you have something you think is true, but can’t state as fact, state it as a hypothesis.

Say “Let’s follow this idea through to its ultimate conclusion” when you’re not sure if an idea will work or not.

Ask “Who else knows more about this? Where can I learn more?”

Define and execute a timeboxed experiment

4. ### Resolve conflicts

Try  as you might to create an ideal collaborative environment, you may  encounter conflict. If you find yourself fighting more than you are  creating, it’s time to turn to the following:

>Notice the conflict

If  you notice that you feel like you’re arguing more than collaborating,  or someone is saying “no” or “but” a lot … collaboration has probably  broken down.

If you notice yourself withdrawing from the  conversation, it is your responsibility to identify why and try to bring  yourself back in.

>Pick your battles

Don’t sweat the small stuff

>Hold your boundaries

If  you don’t like the way you are being treated you must say so. Real  collaboration cannot happen without respect, and additionally, you will  not contribute as well if you feel disrespected.

>Communicate the crossed boundary. Be immediate, brief, direct, and non-blaming.

E.g. “I’m not comfortable with that language. How about X instead.”

E.g. “I would appreciate it if you would not interrupt.”

5. ### Repeat: Align / Listen / Be a Scientist / Resolve Conflict

#### (Re-)Establish Alignment

Find the common ground where you do agree. Keep searching until you find it.

Say “Okay, let’s back up. Do I agree on X?”

Ask (again) “What problem are I trying to solve?”

Listen (like they’re on your side)

Try to find underlying concerns driving their position

Why do they feel strongly?

Ask “What are you worried about?”

Try to listen without judgement, and let them show you where they think the important points of the discussion are.

Repeat back to them what you think they’re saying

“What I’m hearing is…”

#### Be a Scientist

Identify timeboxed experiments you can run with, and win conditions for those experiments

Be willing to “disagree and commit”

Even  if you think a solution is wrong or bad, few solutions are so wrong or  bad that they can’t withstand a test of some kind to establish virtues  and flaws.

If you are hesitant, try to identify the characteristic YOU are worried about, and bring that to the table.

Communicate your concerns, and be willing to try an experiment to learn if they are valid.

Be open to changing your mind.

Ideally  you should do all of the above, but since that’s a lot, I suggest  working on one at a time, consistently, until you start to notice that  you’re doing it without having to remind yourself all the time. In other  words, work on it until it’s become habit.
