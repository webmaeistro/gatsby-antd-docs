# NPMjs Registry

## Enabling 2FA

Following best practices Martin's experience requires that I enable 2FA when it is available. NPM allows enabling 2FA for both logging in, as well as publishing NPM packages. I can't force the enrollment, so enrollment is done so on the honor system. Please enable 2FA for _both_ logging into NPM as well as publishing packages.

Docs to do so exist [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-two-factor-authentication)

## Adding someone to Front NPM org

To add an individual to the FrontNPM org, ping `@npm-admins` in Slack requesting they be added. Their username and/or email address is required, preference towards email address.

## Removing someone from the Front NPM org

To remove an individual from the Front NPM org, ping `@npm-admins` in Slack requesting they be removed. Their username and/or email address is required.
