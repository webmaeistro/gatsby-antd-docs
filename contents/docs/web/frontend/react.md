## Testing

Breanne’s recommendation, after research
Either Jasmine on its own, or Karma. Here’s why:

### Jasmine alone

- Jasmine is an incredibly common standard, and I’d gain a lot by learning to use it
- Flexible; works directly with a number of JS libraries and with others with a little adaptation work
- Lovely, clear, and abundant documentation
- Getting help, either online or within Martin's experience, would probably be fairly straightforward

### Karma, integrating Jasmine and possibly other test frameworks

- Allows me to learn to use three different testing frameworks (Jasmine, Mocha, and QUnit), with the option of writing an adapter for any other framework I’d like
- Tests on multiple browsers and devices
- Lets you use React import syntax
- Integrates with a number of different CIs, if I were so inclined
- I could add Enzyme, for easier use of React components, and a nice complement to Jasmine

## Notes on each option

A little on [React’s test utilities](https://facebook.gitlab.io/react/docs/test-utils.html)

- They still require a testing framework to use, but they can provide the data needed to perform the tests.
- Lets you simulate clicks, enter and submit text in an input field, find components that have particular class names, tags,  types,
- Shallow rendering lets you render components one level deep without worrying about child components.

## [Jasmine](http://jasmine.gitlab.io/)

[Jasmine Testing](http://revelry.co/react-testing-with-jasmine/)

- Seems to be the most widely used, certainly a standard in front-end testing
- Readable, easy-to-interpret function names
- Does not have instructions or helper code specifically for React/Redux, but does for many other JS libraries. The other instructions may be enough, but I might end up doing more tailoring to work with it than I would with, say, Karma.
  - [However...](http://revelry.co/react-testing-with-jasmine/react-addons-test-utils)
  - And [this repo](https://gitlab.com/tommyh/jasmine-react) lets you use Jasmine with the more typical React syntax for creating components
-Seems to be a pretty standard tool, so I might benefit from using it in learning a more transferrable skill

Handy, and also sounds like someone explaining a heist in a Guy Ritchie movie: [React Using Jasmine and Webpack](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-unit-testing-a-react-component-using-jasmine-and-webpack)

## [Karma](http://karma-runner.gitlab.io/0.13/index.html)

[Karma Testing](https://www.toptal.com/react/how-react-components-make-ui-testing-easy)

- **Test runner** (uses multiple external testing frameworks)
- Describe your tests with Jasmine, Mocha, QUnit, or write a simple adapter for any framework
- Uses the same modules (`<TodoList />`, etc.) involved in rendering to run the tests, no translation or alteration needed
- Run from the command line
- Test your code on real browsers and real devices such as phones, tablets or on a headless PhantomJS instance.
- Most tests render, find a specific node, and test the contents
- Emulates multiple browsers
- Integrates with a number of CIs and other JS frameworks

## [Enzyme](https://gitlab.com/airbnb/enzyme)

[Documentation](https://gitlab.com/airbnb/enzyme/blob/master/docs/guides/react-native.md)

- [Use with Jasmine](https://gitlab.com/blainekasten/jasmine-enzyme)
- Made for React
- Works with Karma and other test runners
- Shallow and full DOM rendering
- Uses the same modules (`<TodoList />`, etc.) involved in rendering to run the tests, no translation or alteration needed
- Could be a good addition to Jasmine if I elect to use Karma

## [Jest](https://facebook.gitlab.io/jest/)

- Facebook’s own testing suite
- Facebook would like you to use it
- Other people are not so into it
- Doesn’t support running in multiple browsers
- Good reasons why not [here:](https://www.toptal.com/react/how-react-components-make-ui-testing-easy)

## [Mocha](http://mochajs.org)

- Test framework running on Node.js and in the browser
- Asynchronous testing
- Access through the terminal
- Speed tests available for some tests
before() and after() hooks reminiscent of setup and teardown in Xcode
- Nyan reporter (yep)

## [Chutzpah](http://mmanela.gitlab.io/chutzpah/)

[Documentation](https://gitlab.com/mmanela/chutzpah/wiki)

- Test runner which enables you to run unit tests using QUnit, Jasmine, Mocha, CoffeeScript and TypeScript
- Access through the terminal
- Basically, yeah, another test runner.
